  examples: |
    - Is there any equivalent in teams when sharing a presentation to have other people on the call add tick marks, add test boxes etc like you can in Skype calls? E.g. in Skype, you can share in the presentation mode and all other guys on call can add ticks, crosses, add text notes to the pages etc. and then you can save a copy of the presentation with all annotations attached to it in XPS format. this has been really useful for our agile retrospectives. Now in Teams, we have to flip to whiteboards etc. then screenshot the whiteboard, add this back to the presentation ans then save the presentation and re-present it which is a bit disjointed.
